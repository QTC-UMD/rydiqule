        Overload of :meth:`~.Sensor.add_coupling` which allows for different specification of
        coupling fields which are more reflective of real experimental setups.

        Rabi frequency is a mandatory argument in :class:`~.Sensor` but in :class:`~.Cell`, 
        there are 3 options for laser power specification:

        1. Explicit rabi-frequency definition identical to :class:`~.Sensor`.
        2. Electric field strength, in V/m.
        3. Specification of both beam power and beam waist.

        Any one of these options can be used in place of the standard`rabi_frequency` argument
        of :meth:`~.Sensor.add_coupling`.

        As in :class:`~.Sensor`, if `detuning` is specified, the coupling is assumed
        to act under the rotating-wave approximation (RWA), and `transition_frequency`
        can not be specified. However, unlike in a :class:`~.Sensor`, if `detuning`
        is not specified, in a :class:`~.cell.Cell`, `transition_frequency` will be 
        calculated automatically based on atomic properties rather than taken as an argument.

        Parameters
        ----------
        states: sequence
            Length-2 list-like object (list or tuple) of integers
            corresponding to the numbered states of the cell.
        rabi_frequency: float, optional
            The rabi frequency, in Mrad/s, of the coupling
            field. If specified, `e_field`, `beam_power`, and `beam_waist` cannot
            be specified.
        detuning: float, optional
            Field detuning, in Mrad/s, of a coupling
            in the RWA. If specified, RWA is assumed, otherwise RWA not assumed,
            and transition frequency will be calculated based on atomic properties.
        phase: float, optional
            The relative phase of the field in radians.
            Defaults to zero.
        kvec: sequence, optional
            A three-element iterable that defines the
            atomic doppler shift on a particular coupling field.
            It should have magntiude equal to the doppler shift (in the units of Mrad/s)
            of an atom moving at the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution most probable
            speed, `vP=np.sqrt(2*kB*T/m)`. I.E. `np.linalg.norm(kvec)=2*np.pi/lambda*vP`.
            If equal to `(0,0,0)`, solvers will ignore doppler shifts
            on this field.  Defaults to `(0,0,0)`.
        time_dependence: scalar function, optional
            A scalar function that
            specifies a time-dependent field. The time dependence function
            is defined as a funtion that returns a unitless value as a function
            of time that is multiplied by the `rabi_frequency` parameter.
        label: str, optional
            The user-defined name of the coupling. This does not change
            any calculations, but can be used to track individual couplings, and
            will be reflected in the output of :meth:`~.Sensor.axis_labels`
            Default None results in using the states tuple as the label.
        e_field: float, optional
            Electric field strenth of the coupling in Volts/meter.
            If specified, `rabi_frequency`, `beam_power`, and `beam_waist` cannot
            be specified.
        beam_power: float, optional
            Beam power in Watts.  If specified, `beam_waist`
            must also be supplied, and `rabi_frequency` and `e_field` cannot
            be specified. `beam_power` and `beam_waist` cannot be scanned simultaneously.
        beam_waist: float, optional
            1/e^2 Beam waist (radius) in units of
            meters.  Only necessary when specifying `beam_power`.
        q: int, optional
            Coupling polarization in spherical basis.
            Valid values are -1, 0, 1 for :math:`-\\sigma`, linear, :math:`+\\sigma`.
            Default is 0 for linear.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If `states` is not a list-like of 2 integers.
        ValueError
            If an invalid combination of `rabi_frequency`, `e_field`,
            `beam_power`, and `beam_waist` is provided.
        ValueError
            If `tranistion_frequency` is passed as an argument (it is
            calculated from atomic properties).
        ValueError
            If `beam_power` and `beam_waist` are both sequences.

        Notes
        -----
        .. note::
            Note that while this function can be used directly just as in :class:`~.sensor.Sensor`,
            it will often be called implicitly via :meth:`~.Sensor.add_couplings` which `Cell`
            inherits. While they are equivalent, the second of these options is
            often the more clear approach.
            
        .. note::
            Specifying the beam power by beam parameters or electric field still computes
            the `rabi_frequency` and adds that quantity to the `Cell` to maintain consistency across
            `rydiqule`'s other calculations.
            In other words, `beam_power`, `beam_waist`, and `e_field` will never appear
            as quantities on the graph of a `Cell`.
        
        Examples
