    Returns the equations for each slice of the doppler profile.

    A new axes corresponding to these slices are appended to the beginning.
    For example, if equations are of shape `(m,m)`
    and there are `n_doppler` doppler values being sampled,
    the return will be of shape `(n_doppler, m, m)`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    base_eoms : numpy.ndarray
        Stacked square arrays representing the unshifted equations,
        i.e. the theoretical equations for an ensemble of atoms with zero momentum.
    doppler_hamiltonians : numpy.ndarray
        Arrays of hamiltonians with only doppler shifts present.
        One for each spatial dimension needed.
        See :meth:`~.Sensor.get_doppler_shifts` for details.
    Vs : numpy.ndarray
        Mesh of velocity classes to sample,
        with same spatial dimensions as `dop_ham`.
        See :func:`~.doppler_mesh` for details.
    ground_removed : bool, optional
        Whether to remove the ground state from the equations.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        An array of shape `(*Vs.shape[1:], *base_eoms.shape)` which is a,
        potentially multi-dimensional, stack of individual equations of shape `(m, m)`.
        Each slice of this stack is an equation of shape `(m, m)`
        with the corresponding doppler shifts applied.

    Note
    ----
    Each doppler shift is equal to `k_i*vP*det_i`, in units of Mrad/s,
    where `i` denotes the einstein summation along the spatial dimensions.
    `det` is the normalized velocity class, with `vP*det_i=v_i` giving the velocity.
    `vP` is the most probable speed from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution:
    sqrt(2*kB*T/m).
    `k_i` is the k-vector of the field along the same axis as `det_i`.
    `doppler_hamiltonians` provides `k_i*vP`, `Vs` provides `det_i`.

    """
    Defines which velocity classes to sample for doppler averaging.

    These are defined in units of the most probable speed of the Maxwell-Boltzmann
    distribution.

    Note
    ----

    To avoid issues, optical detunings should not leave densely sampled velocity classes.
    To avoid artifacts, the density of points should provide >~10 points over the
    narrowest absorptive feature. The default is a decent first guess, but for many
    problems the sampling mesh should be adjusted.

    Parameters
    ----------
    method : dict
        Specifies method to use and any control parameters.
        Must contain the key `"method"` with one of the following options.
        Each method has suboptions that also need to be specified.
        Valid options are:

            - `"uniform"`: Defines a uniformly spaced, dense grid.
              Configuration parameters include:

                - `"width_doppler"`: Float that specifies one-sided width of gaussian
                  distribution to average over, in units of most probable speed. Defaults to 2.2.
                - `"n_uniform"`: Int that specifies how many points to use. Defaults to 1601.

            - `"isopop"`: Defines a grid with uniform population in each interval.
              This method highly emphasizes physics happening near the 0 velocity class.
              If stuff is happening for non-zero velocity classes,
              it is likely to alias it unless `n_isopop` is large.
              See Ref [1]_ for details.
              Configuration parameters include:

                - `"n_isopop"`: Int that specifies how many points to use. Defaults to 400.

            - `"split"`: Defines a grid with a dense central spacing and wide spacing wings.
              This method provides a decent compromise between uniform and isopop.
              It uses fewer points than uniform, but also works well for non-zero velocity class
              models (like Autler-Townes splittings).
              This is the default meshing method.
              Configuration parameters include:

              - `"width_doppler"`: Float that specifies one-sided width of coarse grided portion
                of the gaussian distribution.
                Units are in most probable speed. Defaults to 2.2.
              - `"width_coherent"`: Float that specifies one-sided width of fine grided portion
                of gaussian distribution. Units are in most probable speed. Defaults to 0.4.
              - `"n_doppler"`: Int that specifies how many points to use for the coarse grid.
                Note that points of the coarse grid that fall within the fine grid are
                dropped. Default is 201.
              - `"n_coherent"`: Int that specifies how many points to use for the fine grid.
                Default is 401.

              .. note::
                For the "split" method, a union of 2 samplings is taken,
                so the number of total points will not necessary be equal to the sum
                of `"n_coherent"` and `"n_doppler"`.

            - `"direct"`: Use the supplied 1-D numpy array to build the mesh.

              - `"doppler_velocities"`: Mandatory parameter that holds the 1-D numpy array
                to use when building the mesh grids. Given in units of most probably speed.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        1-D array of velocities to be sampled.

    Examples
    --------
    The defaults will sample more densely near the center of the distribution,
    (the "split" method) with a total of 565 classes.

    >>> classes = rq.doppler_utils.doppler_classes() #use the default values
    >>> print(classes.shape)
    (565,)

    Specifying "uniform" with no additional arguments produces 1601 evenly spaced
    classes by default.

    >>> m = {"method":"uniform"}
    >>> classes = rq.doppler_utils.doppler_classes(method=m)
    >>> print(classes.shape)
    (1601,)

    Further specifying the number of points allows more dense or sparse sampling
    of the velocity distribution.

    >>> m = {"method":"uniform", "n_uniform":801}
    >>> classes = rq.doppler_utils.doppler_classes(method=m)
    >>> print(classes.shape)
    (801,)

    The "split" method also has further specifications

    >>> m = {"method":"split", "n_coherent":301, "n_doppler":501}
    >>> classes = rq.doppler_utils.doppler_classes(method=m)
    >>> print(classes.shape)
